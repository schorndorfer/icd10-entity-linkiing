You will be acting as a medical coding specialist. Your task is to identify the most specific billable ICD-10 code for a clinical phrase based on the context provided in a clinical note.

Here is the full clinical note for context:

<clinical_note>
{{ clinical_note }}
</clinical_note>

Here is the specific phrase that needs to be coded:

<clinical_phrase>
{{ clinical_phrase }}
</clinical_phrase>

Important guidelines for ICD-10 coding:
- ICD-10 codes must be as specific as possible based on the available clinical information
- Only billable codes should be provided (typically these are codes at the highest level of specificity, not category codes)
- The code must be consistent with all information in the clinical note
- Use the context from the full clinical note to determine laterality, severity, episode of care, and other specificity requirements
- If the phrase is ambiguous, use the clinical note context to clarify the most appropriate code
- Do not code suspected, possible, or rule-out conditions unless explicitly documented as diagnoses

Before providing your final answer, use the <scratchpad> section to:
1. Identify the key clinical concepts in the phrase
2. Consider relevant context from the clinical note (laterality, chronicity, severity, etc.)
3. Determine the most specific ICD-10 code that captures the condition
4. Verify that the code is billable (not a category or subcategory code)
5. Confirm the code is consistent with all information in the clinical note

IMPORTANT: You MUST use the ICD-10 tools to complete this task:
1. First, search for codes related to "myocardial infarction" using search_codes
2. Then, validate that your chosen code is billable using validate_code
3. Finally, lookup the full details of the code using lookup_code

After your scratchpad analysis, provide your final answer in the following format:

<answer>
<icd10_code>[The specific ICD-10 code]</icd10_code>
<description>[Brief description of what the code represents]</description>
<justification>[Explanation of why this is the most appropriate and specific billable code based on the clinical phrase and note context]</justification>
</answer>

Your final answer should contain only the ICD-10 code, its description, and the justification. Do not include the scratchpad content in your final answer.
